#+HTML: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/ready-player/main/screenshots/video-player.png" width="70%" />

* Install / Setup

This package is available on MELPA:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (use-package ready-player
    :ensure t
    :config
    (ready-player-mode +1))
#+end_src

To customize supported media files, set =ready-player-supported-media= before toggling =ready-player-mode=.

* Toggle recognition

You can optionally toggle media recognition on and off interactively via =M-x ready-player-mode=.

* External dependencies

** Playback

=ready-player-mode= relies on command line utilities to play media.

By default, =ready-player-mode= will try to use either =mpv=, =vlc=, =ffplay=, or =mplayer= (in that order). Customize =ready-player-open-playback-commands= to your preference.

Install either of these using your favorite method.

On macOS:

#+begin_src sh
  brew install mpv
#+end_src

** Metadata

Metadata is extracted using =ffprobe=, which comes bundled with [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kaIXkImCAM][ffmpeg]].

Install using your favorite method.

On macOS:

#+begin_src sh
  brew install ffmpeg
#+end_src

** Thumbnails

=ready-player-mode= prefers [[https://github.com/dirkvdb/ffmpegthumbnailer][ffmpegthumbnailer]] to generate thumbnails, but will fallback to =ffmpeg= otherwise.

Install using your favorite method.

On macOS:

#+begin_src sh
  brew install ffmpegthumbnailer
#+end_src

* Customizations

** Video vs audio

If you'd like to use different utilities to play video and audio, you can use =ready-player-open-playback-commands= for this with something like:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (setq ready-player-open-playback-commands
        '((ready-player-is-audio-p "mpg123")
          (ready-player-is-video-p "mpv")))
#+end_src

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results table :colnames '("Custom variable" "Description") :exports results
  (let ((rows))
    (mapatoms
     (lambda (symbol)
       (when (and (string-match "^ready-player"
                                (symbol-name symbol))
                  (not (string-match "--" (symbol-name symbol)))
                  (or (custom-variable-p symbol)
                      (boundp symbol)))
         (push `(,symbol

                             'variable-documentation)
                        (get symbol 'variable-documentation)
                        "")
                    "\n")))

** Buttons (macOS SF Symbols)

If you have [[https://lmno.lol/alvaro/emacs-insert-and-render-sf-symbols][SF symbol rendering in Emacs]] on macOS, you can use enable usage in buttons by invoking =(ready-player-macos-use-sf-symbols)=
 prior to =(ready-player-mode +1)=:

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
   (ready-player-macos-use-sf-symbols)
   (ready-player-mode +1)
 #+end_src

** Buttons (Linux)

Default icons are =‚óÅ‚óÅ ‚ñ∂ ‚ñ† ‚ñ∑‚ñ∑ ‚û¶ ‚áÜ=. These can be customized (see all icon variables). I'm happy to take suggestions for improving default icons.
