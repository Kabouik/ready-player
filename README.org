* Ready Player Mode

A lightweight major mode to open media (audio/video) files in an Emacs buffer.

[[file:ready-player.png]]
* Setup

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (require 'ready-player)
  (ready-player-add-to-auto-mode-alist)
#+end_src

To customize supported media files, set `ready-player-supported-media' before invoking `ready-player-add-to-auto-mode-alist'.

`ready-player-mode' relies on command line utilities to play media. Customize `ready-player-open-playback-commands' to your preference.

* Customizations

  (let ((rows))
    (mapatoms
     (lambda (symbol)
